        <p class="description">
            The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a religious organisation with branches in more than 200 countries. It is the most dynamic denomination of Islam in modern history, with an estimated membership in the tens of millions worldwide. It was established in 1889 by Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) (1835- 1908) in a small and remote village called Qadian in Punjab, India. He claimed to be the expected reformer of the latter days and the awaited one of the world community of religions(the Mahdi and Messiah of the latter days).
