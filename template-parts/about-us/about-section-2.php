        <h2>HISTORY IN THE UK</h2>
        <p class="description">
            The UK chapter of the community was established in 1913 and in 1924 it built Londonâ€™s first purpose-built mosque (in Southfields), that became a Grade II listed building in 2018 in recognition of its historical significance to the UK. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is, therefore, one of the oldest and most established Muslim communities in Britain and it now has 134 branches across the UK.
